# Forget Me Not List

This is a basic ruby on rails app that allows users to add, check/uncheck and delete items as part of a coding challenge.


## Installation instructions

Requires Ruby version 2.6.3.

Run `bundle install` in the CLI to install all required gems.

Run the app by typing `rails s` in the CLI.

Open http://localhost:3000/ by default unless you've specified otherwise in the configuration.


## Dependencies


## Design Decisions
- SQLite3 was chosen for data storage due to the simplicity and accessibility for such a small application. Also removes an extra dependency to someone reviewing this code and running it locally.
